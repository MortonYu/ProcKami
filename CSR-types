"Ignored" reads return 0, which is the default value when no CSR address matches.
"Ignored" writes are simply not performed.
"None" writes perform a read and then write back the value read.

 * May raise illegal instruction exception if value is reserved (should depend on generator flag).
** May be arbitrary if last written value was illegal (but should deterministically depend on value).
 † For the sake of redundancy.

N.B. CSRRS and CSRRC instructions are considered to modify entire registers, not just
     individual fields.
